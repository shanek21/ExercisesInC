# Reflection 2

## Written Reflection

### Learning Goals

After sprint 1, I became very interested in the small, efficient, and cleanly written tools that can be robustly developed in C. I wanted to focus on learning more about this small tool development process and maybe write something myself that can be used inside of my team's Arduino synthesizer project. I was eventually able to do just that by writing a tool that would write the contents of a specified file to a specified serial port. This was great practice towards writing really clean code and helped to solidify the process of writing small tools in C.

### Teaming and Scrum

My team and I have been making decent use of eduScrum at this stage of our project. Our cards with tasks on them seem slightly broad, but we have been better about defining tasks that can be proven to be done with concrete evidence. We haven't made any adaptations to the teaching team's suggested eduScrum methods. My team continues to stay on schedule with the suggested readings on the SoftSys calendar and this sprint (unlike last sprint) I have been much better about doing the assigned exercises and reading questions on the same day that I do the reading. This has made keeping up with the class calendar's reading schedule a lot smoother.

### Our Project: Arduino Synthesizer

After creating basic functionality of producing different frequencies of waves with a 1-bit DAC on an Arduino, my team and I looked for something more novel that we could do to extend our project. We decided to play basic songs on the Arduino by writing the contents of a song file (written by us in a specific format of <frequency of wave, duration of wave>) to serial and then playing the contents of the song. This song-playing functionality gave us new tasks to complete that felt more novel than the traditional Arduino synthesizer project while also allowing us to split up work more easily, which was a Kaizen of ours after last sprint.

## Head First C Exercises
