#### Team Formation
While not the most elegant process of team formation, I had to select my team knowing that I might have to drop SoftSys in favor of a much-needed AHSE course at Wellesley. I got rather lucky by finding a team with two important qualities: they were planning on being a team with only 3 members anyway (so that if I have to leave, they won't be too greatly impacted), and I bumped into all of my teammates while we were ranking our interests earlier in the class period - our learning goals were aligned.

#### Picking a Project
Every member of my team knew that we wanted a project that we could complete really confidently, where we could dive into the details if time allowed. This led us to pick the Arduino Synthesizer project, which was well-tried before us. This project also aligned really well with each of our individual learning goals and synthesized team learning goals, which we all wrote onto post-it notes and shared with the team.

#### Scrum Decisions
My team's scrum master (Nathan) volunteered after every member of our team skimmed over relevant portions of the eduScrum text. We then looked at the SoftSys calendar and filled our sprint backlog with upcoming assigmnents, readings, and exercises. After we conclude our research about the logistics of creating an Arduino Synthesizer, we are going to populate our backlog with project deadlines and to-dos. If I am aprehensive about anything, it would be that we are currently having a hard time breaking our project into smaller pieces in order to digest it (find logical progressions, steps, goals, etc). I hope that we will have a much better idea of how to logically progress through our project after our research phase and after we complete a basic exercise in writing an Arduino program in C.
